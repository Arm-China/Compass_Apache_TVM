It is structured into four parts:
### Getting Started
- A simple introduction to Compass DSL.
- A step-by-step installation guide.
- A simple introduction to the build and run workflow.
- Tutorials: How to use Compass DSL to write a kernel?

### How-to Guides
These are step-by-step guides on how to solve specific problems. In a how-to guide, we assume that
the user already knows some basic knowledge and can use basic tools.
Each title of topics in how-to-guides is a specific question.

```
Tutorials V.S. How-to-guides?
