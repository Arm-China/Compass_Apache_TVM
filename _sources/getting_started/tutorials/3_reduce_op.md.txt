# Tutorial 3: Reduce Operator

In this tutorial, you will write a simple reduction operator using Compass DSL. You will learn about:
* The basic builtin of max, vrpmax
* How to write a max-reduction operator with 1D data
* How to write a max-reduction operator with 2D data (alone row axis)

## Basic Built-in

Before we write the reduction operator, letâ€™s look at some basic built-in about the max operator.
- max: compute the elementwise maximum of two vectors
```
    x: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
    y: 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5

  out = S.max(x, y)
  out: 5 5 5 5 5 6 7 8
```
- vrpmax: compute the reduction maximum value of the vector
```
    x: 10 20 3 4 5 6 7 8

  out = S.vrpmax(x)
  out: 20 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
For addtional information, you can refer to `vadd`, `vrpadd`.

## Writing a Max Reduction Operator with 1-Dimensional Data
We want to write a reduction operation to find the maximum element in a 1-Dimension array.

First, we need to consider the basic logic of how a reduction operates. Here is a conceptual pseudocode for a 1D max reduction:
```py
def max_reduction_1d(input):
    max_val = input[0]
    for value in input:
        max_val = maximum(max_val, value)
    return max_val
```

If we want to implement this with vector built-in, we can use `max` and `vrpmax`. The basic idea is:

1. Convert the loop_n into n//VEC_LEN, for each loop, perform the vector maximum operation using `max`.
2. Use `vrpmax` to compute the reductional maximum value of the vector computed by the previous step.

Here is the kernel code:
```py
dtype = "uint32"
n = 8 * 4

@S.prim_func
def max_reduction_1d(a: S.ptr(dtype, "global"), b: S.ptr(dtype, "global")):
    v_max = S.uint32x8(0)  # for uint, init v_max with 0
    for vi in range(n // 8):
        va = S.vload(a + vi * 8)
        v_max = S.max(v_max, va)
    v_max = S.vrpmax(v_max)
    b[0] = v_max[0]
```

## Writing a Max Reduction Operator with 2-Dimensional Data (Alone Row Axis)

In this section, we want to compute the maximum along the rows of a 2D array:
- input: [batch, n]
- output: [batch]

Here is a conceptual pseudocode for a 2D max reduction along rows:
```py
def max_reduction_2d(input):
    result = []
    for row in input:
        max_val = row[0]
        for value in row:
            max_val = maximum(max_val, value)
        result.append(max_val)
    return result
```
In this case, we can split the batch dimensions into NUM_TEC parts, and for each TEC, reuse the 1-Dimension logic.
![](../../_static/reduction_max_2d.jpg)

Here is the kernel code:
```py
batch = 8
NUM_TEC = 4
each_tec_batch = batch // NUM_TEC

@S.prim_func
def max_reduction_2d(a: S.ptr(dtype, "global"), b: S.ptr(dtype, "global")):
    # a [batch,n]
    # b [batch]
    for ti in S.tec_range(0, NUM_TEC):
        for loop_t in range(each_tec_batch):
            off_batch = ti * each_tec_batch + loop_t
            # 1d-max reduction
            v_max = S.uint32x8(0)
            for vi in range(n // 8):
                va = S.vload(a + off_batch * n + vi * 8)
                v_max = S.max(v_max, va)
            v_max = S.vrpmax(v_max)
            # store output
            b[off_batch] = v_max[0]
```

## Complete Code
You can find the sample code in `PYTHON_PACKAGE_PATH/tvm/aipu/samples/dsl/tutorial_3_reduce_op.py`.
The placeholder `PYTHON_PACKAGE_PATH` represents the location where you install the Compass DSL
Python package, in general, it will be something like `~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages`.
